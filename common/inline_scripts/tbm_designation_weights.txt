# TBM - AI Planet Designation Archetypes

### owner = country ###
### from = planet ###

# Basic planet designation weighting applied to (almost) every feature.
# General idea is we want rural, research, and unity planets to keep more bonuses; industrial and urban worlds, less so.
# Specialized resource districts (i.e., farming) are handled in each feature to avoid over-generalization.
# Not called on most negative features as the logic is inverse; these are handled in deposits.
# This also contains the vanilla Environmentalist modifier.
