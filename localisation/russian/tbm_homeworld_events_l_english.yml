 tbm_hw.6_name:0 "Geothermal Plant Shutdown"
 tbm_hw.6_desc_gestalt:0 "By the mid-21st century, we had hoped geothermal power would sate growing energy needs. This estimate proved incorrect and many older §Y£blocker_yellow£ $d_experimental_geothermal_tap$s§! have long since been been shut down due to failing efficiency scores.\n\nA few, however, remain, creaking out heating rods and turning creaking steam engines to help increase strategic energy reserves. Newly developed evaluations algorithms have revealed serious problems with aging pre-nanocomposite gantries might collapse, causing unacceptable structural damage to the area surrounding the tap.\n\nIt would be more efficient to dismantle the few of these reactors still in use. They are, however, still considered part of our potential £district_generator£ capacity."
 tbm_hw.6_desc:0 "By the mid-21st century, geothermal power was supposed to solve all of our energy needs.

But the scale on which the larger §Y£blocker_yellow£ Experimental Geothermal Tap§!s operate can lead to the relase of dangerous levels of heat and gas from deep in the [from.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust if not properly maintained.\n\nAfter decades of neglect and decay, one ofthe §Y£blocker_yellow£ Experimental Geothermal Tap§! on [from.GetName] suddenly exploded, causing significant damage to the surrounding $district_city_plural$ and spewing noxious gases across much of the region.\n\nClean-up is underway, but the technology behind this form of energy generation has now been entirely deprecated and banned from large-scale use in future energy generators."

But we have waited this long.\n\n\n\n§EOver the next several decades, our undertakings will forever shape the face and future of our homeworld - decisions governing development, population, industry, and the environment will all determine the outcome of our efforts to rebuild our civilization.\n\nRestoration will occur in three areas:\n - §LIndustrialization§! - A measure of civilization's wealth, productivity, and ability to return to the levels of plentitude required to sustain a true stellar empire. Are we resilient and frugal? Or opulent and utopian?\n - §GEcology§! - Restoring a planetary-scale environment from utter devastation is a mammoth charge. Do we embrace the burnt-out world we've made or rebuild whole rivers and oceans?\n - §YCulture§! - Do we seek to spread fire or influence, or might?

It's dangerous work for those brave enough to risk life and limb out on the radioactive wastes.\n\nNow, after a romantic falling-out between two rival clan-members, the leaders of each band have announced lucrative prices -- on each other. Their always-heavily-armed underlings are going at it with great gusto, seeking recognition and renown among the squalid remains of [owner.GetAdj] society.\n\nIt's unclear if there's any real possibility of a lull in the fighting.
