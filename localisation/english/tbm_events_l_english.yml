A mineral seam previously thought to be rich in heavy metals and other elements essential to construction and alloy production was revealed to be riddled with impurities and instabilities, making any attempt to mine the region both dangerous and cost-ineffective.\n\nNot all is lost, however! The prospecting boom brought many new faces to [planet.GetName], some of whom have chosen to stay and contribute to colonial development in other ways. And trade through the [planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s spaceport has been brisk for the past several months."
